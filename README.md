Runner's Calculator for BlackBerry® is a fitness utility that calculates your BMI, maximum HR and other running information like speed, pace, burnt calories, intensity, body fat loss and much more.

If you discover an issue with the app, please let us know and give us a chance to help you, before you rate the app poorly. You cannot change the rating you give an app in BlackBerry World™, once you’ve given it. Send us an e-mail to info@pronic.si. We will respond as soon as possible.
